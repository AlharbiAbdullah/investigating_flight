## About the dataset: 

- I Downloded the dataset from the Statistical Computing Statistical Graphics website. I gathered all of the data for the year of 2018. The website wouldn't allow me to downlod it once, so I downloded each month separatlly. Then I will concat all the data in one master dataframe. The dataset has around 7M observations.


## Main Findings: 

- The busiest months for delayed flights are Jan,Dec, and Nov
- The best days to travel are Tuesday and Thursday due to low rate of delay
- American Airlines, Hawaiian airlines, and Skeywest Airlines are the best airline becuase they have low rate of delays.
